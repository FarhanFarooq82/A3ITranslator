# Audio Management Architecture Simplification

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified AudioRecordingManager Interface
- **Added TypeScript interfaces**: Created proper interfaces for `AudioValidationOptions` and `RecordingCallbacks` to improve type safety and make the API more clear.
- **Consolidated callback functions**: Replaced multiple separate callback parameters with a single `callbacks` object for better organization and scalability.
- **Improved documentation**: Added JSDoc comments to clarify the purpose of each method and interface.
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better error reporting and validation throughout the class.

### 2. Streamlined useRecordingManager Hook
- **Simplified state management**: Used `useMemo` for the returned interface to optimize performance.
- **Fixed type issues**: Properly exported types and consolidated interfaces.
- **Improved error handling and state updates**: More consistent state transitions with clearer error states.
- **Better cleanup logic**: Ensured all resources are properly released.

### 3. Re-engineered TranslationContext
- **Resolved circular dependencies**: Used a ref-based approach to avoid circular dependencies between functions.
- **Enhanced timer management**: Better organization of timers with a consistent cleanup API.
- **Improved type safety**: Fixed implicit 'any' types and other TypeScript issues.

### 4. Added Integration Tests
- Created integration tests for the AudioRecordingManager to ensure its functionality with the new API.

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Cleaner API Contracts**: The interfaces between components are now well-defined with proper TypeScript types.

2. **Better Separation of Concerns**:
   - AudioRecordingManager: Focuses on managing the recording process and audio validation
   - useRecordingManager: Handles React state management and exposes a clean API to React components
   - TranslationContext: Coordinates high-level application state and behaviors

3. **Improved Performance**:
   - More efficient rendering with useMemo and useCallback optimizations
   - Better cleanup of resources preventing memory leaks

4. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - Clear responsibility boundaries between components
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Better documentation
   - Stronger type safety

## How It Works Now

1. TranslationContext coordinates the overall application flow
2. When recording needs to start:
   - TranslationContext calls useRecordingManager.startRecording with callback functions
   - useRecordingManager delegates to AudioRecordingManager
   - AudioRecordingManager handles the low-level audio recording logic

3. When silence is detected:
   - AudioRecordingManager calls the onSilenceComplete callback
   - This triggers stopRecording in the TranslationContext
   - TranslationContext handles UI updates and translation processing

This design maintains separation of concerns while simplifying the interfaces between components, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
