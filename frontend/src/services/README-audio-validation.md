# Audio Validation Changes

## Migration from AudioValidator to Hark-based Detection

We've simplified the audio validation process by leveraging the real-time speech detection capabilities of the Hark library. This change eliminates the need for post-recording audio analysis and provides a more efficient way to validate recordings.

### Key Changes:

1. **Added Speech Detection Tracking**:
   - The `AudioService` now tracks whether speech was detected during recording via the `speechDetected` flag.
   - Speech detection happens in real-time as part of the normal recording process.

2. **Removed Dependency on AudioValidator**:
   - The `AudioRecordingManager` now uses `audioService.hasSpeechDetected()` instead of `AudioValidator.validateRecording()`.
   - This eliminates the need for complex post-recording analysis.

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Faster feedback when no speech is detected.
   - More accurate validation since we're detecting actual speech patterns in real-time.
   - Simplified codebase with fewer dependencies.

### Implementation Details:

- Added `speechDetected` flag to AudioService
- Added `hasSpeechDetected()` method to AudioService
- Updated the `stopped_speaking` Hark event handler to set the flag
- Modified AudioRecordingManager's `stopRecording` method to use the new approach

### Future Considerations:

- The AudioValidator class can now be safely removed if it's not used elsewhere.
- If more sophisticated audio analysis is needed in the future, it can be reimplemented as a separate service.
